# BrewDog Market Analysis and Cluster Algorithm Implementation

## Introduction
The global beer market is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. With the rise in demand predicted, BrewDog, a multinational brewery and pub chain, aims to tailor its marketing strategies to meet customer preferences for increased competitiveness. This project focuses on utilizing cluster analysis to identify customer segments and tailor marketing campaigns accordingly.

## Missing Data Handling
Data cleaning is a crucial aspect of any data analysis process, with missing data being a common issue. Handling missing data is essential to prevent bias and ensure accurate results. Various methods like deletion, maximum likelihood estimation, and imputation can be employed to address missing values effectively.

### Methods for Handling Missing Data
- **Deletion**:
  - *Listwise*: Remove entire rows with missing values.
  - *Pairwise*: Analyze data for specific variables and delete missing values as needed.
- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: Estimate missing values based on available data.
- **Imputation**: Replace missing values using statistical methods like mean, mode, or multiple imputation.

## Clustering Algorithm Implementation
Clustering analysis is utilized to segment customer preferences based on variables like ABV, IBU, EBC, and others. The process involves scaling data, checking for outliers, calculating Euclidean distances, selecting a clustering algorithm (Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering), determining the number of clusters, and visualizing results through a dendrogram.

### Results Analysis
- **Cluster Identification**: The dataset is divided into four clusters based on similarities in variables.
- **Beer Classification**: The classification of beers based on yeast type is determined for each cluster.
- **Cluster Mean Values**: Mean values of key variables (ABV, IBU, EBC) for each cluster are analyzed to understand characteristics.

## Conclusion
By employing cluster analysis and effectively handling missing data, BrewDog can gain valuable insights into customer preferences and optimize marketing strategies to cater to diverse segments. The implementation of these analytical techniques can aid in preparing for the forecasted growth in the beer market and staying competitive in the industry.
